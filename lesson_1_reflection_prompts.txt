How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

	I tried to read those lines which were added in new file i.e. with 
	+ sign at the beginning of line.


How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    If I have the whole history of a file with me,I can look how it was
    was changed and what changes were made at different time.So I won't be 
    looking the whole files, rather only looking at changes would save my 
    time and energy.Moreover this would be easy to understand.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?
	
	for manual commits,
    pros : the user can give the name of change what he/she desires.
    	   and depending upon user's ability to understand changes,
    	   they can decrease or increase size of changes made.
    cons : if one forgets to commit there can be problem.

    for having automatical commits
    pros : if one forgets to do, there won't be any problem.
   	coms : size will be fixed.
   		   tough to understand as compared with manual.


Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

     version control systems, like Git, are more oriented for software building
     thus having inter-dependencies, and hence allowing saving multiple files 
     in one commit.
     while others, like Google Docs, are more focussed for general purpose
     thus less interdependencies and hence treats each file separately.


How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    git log : it shows all commits made which can be fitted in screen,entering
    		  further shows the further commits,and when one find the desired
    		  commit then can quit by pressing q(quit).
   	git diff <commit ID1> <commitID2>
   			: this show all the changes made in file with commit ID1 
   			  green +, line show lines that were added to file with commit ID1
   			  and red minuses shows lines which were deleted from file
   			  with commit ID1.


How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    As I can keep record of changes which I make, and easy shift to that 
    changed file from current file and vice-versa,thus there won't be any 
    worry while making alteration to files.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    I would love to use git for developing my Android apps projects.
    As well as do some competetive programming here,as I make make frequently
    which sometime leads me to wrong answer, and making it tough to get back.
    Now there would be fun to reach it back.
