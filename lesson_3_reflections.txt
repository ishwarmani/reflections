When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

   When collabrating with other developers I would prefer to use a remote repository.
   And if we 3-4 friends are working in project then also I would prefer remote over 
   local repository.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically 
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	When working in collabration then automatically remoting may cause a problem since
	one may not wanna get changes made by other.And when done manually one can look, 
	understand and then pull.
