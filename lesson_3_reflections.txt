When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

   When collabrating with other developers I would prefer to use a remote repository.
   And if we 3-4 friends are working in project then also I would prefer remote over 
   local repository.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically 
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	When working in collabration then automatically remoting may cause a problem since
	one may not wanna get changes made by other.And when done manually one can look, 
	understand and then pull.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one 
instead of another?

	fork : It allows us to make copy of someone's repository to our owm account.
		   It can be said as cloning from github to github account.
	clone : It allows us to get directly a repository from our or any other's github
			account to local device.
	branch : A branch represents an independent line of development.It is helpful 
			 when many collabrators are working and also for experimenting.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
	
	It is helpful if we are working offline and want to know about it and want
	to run git diff to get changes with local master.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would
 be harder?

 	Without Git and Github, collabration would be very tough as then files need to swapped
 	with other collabrator and describing him what he/she has changed and both need to 
 	have conversation for this, thus taking lot of time. And understanding different version 
 	also be tough.
